# HTML5CSS3
Basic ideas to train the most common tags in HTML and CSS.

Exercise with simple content, an HTML5 page, with semantic tags, to identify sections to train responsiveness and different CSS configurations for each size (small, medium, and large) with resizing.
This is one of the existing resources, but it does not mean that the way it was made is the best way to get responsiveness in CSS, this depends on the application if it will be worth it for its customization.

This exercise is a good way to learn how to use semantic tags and responsive CSS.
By identifying the sections of a page and creating different CSS configurations for each size, you can learn how to make your web pages look good on different devices and screen sizes.

Here are some specific steps you can follow to complete this exercise:

You should see a page with three sections. The sections will be displayed in different sizes depending on the size of your screen.

To test the responsiveness of your page, resize your browser window. The sections should automatically resize to fit the width of your screen.

You can customize the CSS code to change the look and feel of your page. For example, you could add images, videos, or other content to the sections. You could also change the colors, fonts, and sizes of the text.

The most important thing is to experiment with different CSS configurations to see what works best for your page.

Thanks for your time! :D
